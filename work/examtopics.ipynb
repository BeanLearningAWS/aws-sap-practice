    "A company is hosting a critical application on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application uses an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis single-node cluster for an in-memory data store. The application uses an Amazon RDS for MariaDB DB instance for a relational database. For the application to function, each piece of the infrastructure must be healthy and must be in an active state.\n",

    "## Question 10\n",
    "A retail company is operating its ecommerce application on AWS. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company uses an Amazon RDS DB instance as the database backend. Amazon CloudFront is configured with one origin that points to the ALB. Static content is cached. Amazon Route 53 is used to host all public zones.\n",
    "After an update of the application, the ALB occasionally returns a 502 status code (Bad Gateway) error. The root cause is malformed HTTP headers that are returned to the ALB. The webpage returns successfully when a solutions architect reloads the webpage immediately after the error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the company is working on the problem, the solutions architect needs to provide a custom error page instead of the standard ALB error page to visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which combination of steps will meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? (Choose two.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure the S3 bucket to host a static webpage. Upload the custom error pages to Amazon S3.\n",
    "2. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke an AWS Lambda function if the ALB health check response Target.FailedHealthChecks is greater than 0. Configure the Lambda function to modify the forwarding rule at the ALB to point to a publicly accessible web server.\n",
    "3. Modify the existing Amazon Route 53 records by adding health checks. Configure a fallback target if the health check fails. Modify DNS records to point to a publicly accessible webpage.\n",
    "4. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke an AWS Lambda function if the ALB health check response Elb.InternalError is greater than 0. Configure the Lambda function to modify the forwarding rule at the ALB to point to a public accessible web server.\n",
    "5. Add a custom error response by configuring a CloudFront custom error page. Modify DNS records to point to a publicly accessible web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: 1, 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- 2 & 4: using Lambda to modify ALB require more operational overhead and add complexity\n",
    "- 3: if a client request come before health check, error page won't be shown"
